<h1>Coffee Maker exercise</h1>

This project is part of the Coursera course <b>Introduction to Software Testing</b>. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-software-testing/home/welcome">Here is the link</a>.

The parts completed by me is the CoffeeMakerTest.java file, which contains JUnit tests for the CoffeeMaker class (provided by the exercise).

The project contains two versions of the CoffeeMaker:
- Assign: assignment version, contains few bugs which should be uncovered by the JUnit tests.
- Golden: debugged version which can be used as benchbmark, all the JUnit tests must pass there.
